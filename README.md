This is the **Task 03** of my internship at **Elevate Labs**. 

**Objective**

Use free tools to identify common vulnerabilities on your computer.

**Tools I used**
1. Nessus Essentials: Find vulnerabilities in my device. 
2. Command prompt: Find my IP address

**What I found**
I found only one medium vulnerability: SSL cannot be trusted.

**How to fix**
Use a valid SSL certificate from a trusted CA if the system is public
